## Scientific Interests

- wave turbulence, turbulence closure modeling
- nonlinear gyrokinetics
- solar wind, cosmic ray, tokamak

Specific interests:
- kinetic Alfven wave (L.Chen&A.Hasegawa)
- non-resonant streaming instability (Bell's instability)

I have an inclination to nonlinear plasma physics problems that can be treated by closure models, e.g. weak turbulence, dynamo, and eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) approximation; and numerical simulations. I have been working on space, high-energy astrophysical, and fusion plasmas described by fluid, gyrokinetic or kinetic models.

## Philosophy

I tend to look at firstly the conservative properties and symmetries of a self-consistent system, sometimes based on its (non-)canonical Hamiltonian picture, including Lie-Poisson brackets and Casimir invariants. Instabilities, nonlinear dynamics and statistical properties can then be analyzed. Deterministic mode-couplings and statistical closure models, at this stage, can offer physical pictures and insights, while details and verifications are delivered by parallel numerical simulations.
