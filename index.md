## About Me
Interests: 
- wave turbulence, turbulence closure modeling
- kinetic Alfv\'en wave
- non-resonant streaming instability
- nonlinear gyrokinetics
- solar wind, cosmic ray, tokamak

I have an inclination to nonlinear plasma physics problems that can be treated by closure models, e.g. weak turbulence, dynamo, and eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) approximation; and numerical simulations. I have been working on space, high-energy astrophysical, and fusion plasmas described by fluid, gyrokinetic or kinetic models.
